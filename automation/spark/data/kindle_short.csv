13,B000FA64PK,"[0, 0]",3,"Troy Denning's novella Recovery was originally published in e-book form and is a short tale set after the events of Kathy Tyers' Balance Point. Han and Leia Solo's relationship was fractured early in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion by the death of someone in the family, and the books prior to Recovery, notably the Agents of Chaos duology, spent time exploring Han's journey to reclaim himself from his demons and Leia's efforts to be patient with the process.  Ms. Tyers reunited the couple in Balance Point as the battle for Duros commenced, but it is in this short story that they truly begin the emotional healing process.We start on Corellia with a battle in a hospital and an appearance from Han's rogue cousin Thracken Sal-Solo. It's good to touch base on what Sal-Solo has been up to since he fired the Centerpoint weapon earlier in the New Jedi Order. Mr. Denning uses this story to introduce a group of his preferred characters, a tight-knit group of saurian Barabel Jedi. Here they are accompanied by an entertainingly non-conventional, salt-addicted Arcona Jedi as well as a human Jedi, Master Eelysa, known for her lengthy and complicated solo missions. The Barabel come into full play in Mr. Denning's own Star by Star and are memorable characters: it's welcome, if certainly not essential, to have their background more fully fleshed out here.In fact, the Jedi provide the most entertaining aspect of Recovery. The Solo reactions to the explicitly non-human worldview of the Barabel are genuinely funny, especially as they struggle to comprehend Barabel humor. Mr. Denning handles the evolution of their relationship and concurrent healing capably enough, although no aspect of this jumps out at me as especially memorable. The final two chapters take the story on a race to Coruscant to stop a potentially disastrous Senate vote. This portion feels rushed, as if it was constrained by the limitations of being a short e-book, but it brings events to a satisfying close nevertheless.Certainly not an essential read, Recovery does flesh out aspects of the New Jedi Order and it worth a look to anyone reading that part of the saga, especially if you are a fan of Mr. Denning's later novels and want to get a bit more insight into the origin of a couple of his preferred Jedi characters.","03 15, 2012",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Han and Leia reunited and Barabel Jedi introduced,1331769600

21,B000FA64QO,"[0, 0]",2,"With Ylesia, a novella originally published in e-book form, Walter Jon Williams gets an opportunity to insert further story into his novel Destiny's Way. The events of Ylesia take place midway through that book, so this is a good read to tackle immediately after finishing Destiny's Way. The novella follows a New Republic mission to the titular planet, which is serving as the capital of the traitorous Peace Brigade and houses their attempt at a Senate. The Peace Brigade promote capitulation to the Yuuzhan Vong and have served as a human counterpoint to the efforts of the Jedi and the more heroic members of the New Republic throughout the New Jedi Order. They are a logical part of the story but not one I've found terribly interesting, as we rarely get anything told from their point-of-view, making them rather cardboard as adversaries.Yleisa brings back Thracken Sal-Solo in an entertaining plotline which sees him forcibly installed as the President of the Peace Brigade. This doesn't fit well with Sal-Solo's plans to better his own galactic situation but he displays a knack for adaption and survival not unlike that of his famous cousin Han Solo. Ylesia itself, a major source of the drug spice in the Star Wars galaxy, will be familiar to readers of A. C. Crispin's Han Solo Trilogy, and it's nice to see it return.For the most part Yleisa doesn't advance the story of Destiny's Way much: primarily, it delivers some closure to the Peace Brigade subplot. Sal-Solo was the most memorable aspect, as some of the space battle and ground assault material following the New Republic's invasion of the system felt like material I've read an awful lot of times before.  Ylesia is a solid enough little story but I would only recommend it to someone going through the entire New Jedi Order and wanting a little more.","03 15, 2012",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Minor New Jedi Order side story,1331769600

However, the New Republic forces also choose to attack Ylesia. There's nothing new or terribly exciting in the novel, but it's a nice side story. It's written in a similar style asDestiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 14), which isn't surprising as they're both by the same author. This short story actually takes place during the novel, so I'd recommend reading the novel first so Ylesia doesn't spoil any surprises.","05 17, 2011",AQZH7YTWQPOBE,Enjolras,A Thrackan story,1305590400

27,B000FBFMVG,"[5, 5]",3,"Originally published as an e-book coinciding with the release of the novel Tatooine Ghost, Troy Denning's A Forest Apart is a short story following Chewbacca, his wife Mallatobuck, and his son Lumpy on a adventure into the bowels of Coruscant. Malla and Lumpy are visiting Chewie at his Coruscant apartment when a break-in at the next-door Solo place turns out to have more serious ramifications. The Wookiees follow the burglars and end up unearthing an Imperial plot set in place by an old tool of the villainous Ysanne Isard.There's a lot of action in a short space but not much time for meaningful character development. Lumpy is a pre-teen striving to find his place in the world, and Chewbacca's perpetual absence in his life may have left a gaping hole as far as having a father figure to look up to. There's not enough pages to explore this theme with much depth, and in the end the issue is dropped, since on a practical level Lumpy can't live with his father chasing all over the galaxy anyway. The theme of the impact a Wookiee Life Debt has on the Wookiee holding it and on his/her family is an interesting one that could be explored in more detail with a longer story.Unlike many novels which handle Chewie's communications by having him grunt and then having a nearby character paraphrase what he said, Denning makes the wise choice of letting the Wookiees speak as normal characters and simply puts brackets to indicate they are actually using their native tongue. It's always enjoyable seeing Chewbacca in action, and even though this story doesn't really add anything significant to the larger saga, it's an entertaining diversion.","08 25, 2008",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Short story featuring everyone's favorite Wookiee,1219622400

This book ""A Forest Apart"" wasn't on par with his other works.  It wasn't without it's charm, but it had things in it that I didn't like.The story itself is pretty simple.  It's a coming of age story for Chewbacca's son, and instead of coming of age on Kashyyyk, he is growing up on Coruscant.  It's not horrible, and we find out that Lumpy is an avid gamer and enjoys playing video games and that he idolizes his father.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***First of all, why is Han Solo on the cover?  He's not even IN this story other than a few mentions of his name.  Why not have Chewbacca and Lumpy instead of Han and Chewie?  Also, I HATE books where Chewbacca's grunts and growls are translated.  Like in the Black Fleet Trilogy, he had his speech translated and it was just stupid.  I feel that he works much better as a strong silent type who speaks through his actions rather than his words.  I mean imagine in characters like Jason Vorhees, Michael Meyers, Silent Bob, or Sphynx (from Gone in 60 Seconds), all just started having lengthy conversations throughout their movies?  They lose some of what makes those characters awesome.  Sometimes an author can say very much by having a character say very little.My only other problem with the book is when Chewie and Malla have the droid ""IT"" in their blaster sights, his back is to them and he doesn't see them.  Why don't they just shoot him?  Instead they send Lumpy out as a ""distraction.""  Yet he doesn't really do anything worth mentioning to distract IT and his minions.  He walks out on the observation deck where they are hiding, opens the window and drops down to the level where IT and his minions are loading nerve gas onto transport ships.  I mean that's not much of a distraction, besides the point of a distraction is to get someone's attention away from one spot so you can do something while they are not looking.  Well, IT wasn't looking in your direction to begin with, so why bother?  They could have just taken up positions on the observation deck and shot him.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Okay so this story wasn't really bad other than a few minor details I didn't like.

35,B000FC1BN8,"[1, 1]",3,"Timothy Zahn's Fool's Bargain is a short story originally published in e-book form and set before the events of his novel Survivor's Quest. This tale covers an assignment Aurek Company of the Imperial 501st receives on the embattled planet Kariek. The focus is on the four troopers who comprise Aurek-Seven and in particular their leader Twister. This is the same squad that plays a part in Survivor's Quest, minus one personnel change which is detailed in this story. There aren't many Expanded Universe stories that take the Imperial point of view, so this is a welcome perspective here. By this stage in the galaxy's history, years after the Battle of Endor, certain elements of the Empire have developed a more enlightened perspective of the universe around them. These troopers are honorable soldiers fighting for a government they believe in, one that no longer ruthlessly oppresses subject populations but rather plays more of a protector role.The Empire of the films is notably a human-centric organization. Zahn opens the door to alien Imperials in this story with the introduction of Su-mil, an Eickarie and a Kariek native swept up in a civil war. There is a clever bit of deception on Su-mils part involving the Eickarie concept of a lie (they term a lie ""left-handed,"" vs. a truth which is ""right-handed"" - this must be awkward for the native left-handed Eickaries!). By fighting together, Twister sees a potentially valuable ally in Su-mil and we get a perspective of how a stormtrooper unit might be something a soldier would actually aspire to join, rather than simply being cannon fodder for Rebel heroes.All in all, Fool's Bargain is an enjoyable vignette of Imperial life that expands a bit on characters from Survivor's Quest and also provides an interesting preview of the Imperial perspective Zahn went on to explore more thoroughly in his novel Allegiance. It can be purchased in electronic form and is also available in the paperback version ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars).","09 24, 2010",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Enjoyable Imperial slice-of-life story,1285286400

42,B000FC1BN8,"[0, 0]",2,"I admit it, I snapped this up the moment I saw it on new releases, because I tend to do that with anything written by Timothy Zahn. He is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary sci-fi authors where it comes to world building, intricate plot, and edge-of-seat action. His Thrawn and Conqueror's trilogies were incredible, Quadrail and Cobra were very unique and engaging, and even his one-off novels like Icarus Hunt and Outbound Flight are excellent. So I figured this would be too.First off, when I hit the end my jaw dropped and I literally said aloud ""Huh? That's it?!"" I then spent several minutes looking to see if it picked up somewhere else. It is a really short story, barely longer than some of the ones that appear in the 'Tales' Star Wars series (and those books have several of them!). It's also, I must say, a lot less interesting than most of them and probably the single weakest plot I've seen Zahn write. It's not terrible, but it really isn't that great either- there's no twists and at the end you're left wondering where the other half of the story is. The novella revolves around a force of Stormtroopers who are only somewhat memorable (as is the case with most such white-armored shock troops) and though there is quite a bit of action, it kind of reads like a (short) movie or videogame script.Overall, not worth paying for. In fact, it should really be free if you ask me.","01 17, 2013",A1YEPFLLH42OU1,"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia ""Yu-Jin Chia""",An average short story,1358380800
43,B000FC1BN8,"[0, 0]",5,"I love Timothy Zahn's work!  He does what no other writer, not even George Lucas himself can do.  He takes the rank and file Storm Troopers and gives them personalities, talents, skills and makes them multi-dimensional characters that people can get invested in.Where most writers show the Storm Troopers as faceless cannon fodder who can't hit anything with their blasters, Zahn shows them as competent sharpshooting elite commandos who can think on their feet and adapt to any situation as well as follow orders.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***So the story is a pretty basic one.  There is an alien warlord who is ruling a planet with an iron fist, and the Empire decides it is time to go and free the plant of his rule, so they dispatch the 501st Legion a.k.a. Vader's Fist to take him down.There is something I do wonder about though, this takes place after Vader is dead, and after Thrawn's rule has ended.  So why does the 501st Legion keep calling themselves ""Vader's Fist?""  Vader's not around anymore?  Do they keep the name just for the sake of nostalgia?  It's not really a major gripe, just something that makes me scratch my head.Our main characters are three Storm Troopers who all have different skills and specialties.  They infiltrate the warlord's fortress and meet up with some of the local freedom fighters and strike a deal with them.  If the troopers help them free their imprisoned comrades, they will help the troopers get inside and take out the warlord's troops and bring him to justice.The troopers agree and they infiltrate the stronghold together.  Later it seems the rebels have betrayed the Storm Troopers, but it turns out it is just a very elaborate ruse and the rebels were always on the side of the troopers and the prisoners are freed and the warlord is captured by the Empire and brought to justice.Later the head of the rebels is offered a position in the 501st Legion, which is awesome!  It really helps to enforce the fact that the Empire has learned that just having humans in their military doesn't help, it's a hindrance and it was the main reason the Rebel Alliance was able to defeat them.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Zahn gives us action, gun fights, intrigue and a little bit of politics as well in this story.

Since then I have read several more of L'Amour's books and have enjoyed all of them.  I will review them here over the next few weeks, time permitting.This book tells the story of how a young man from New York City ends up in a small Kansas town and picks up the job of being the Sheriff one day before all hell is scheduled to break loose.

I'm glad I also have the Shambhala book, because some of the typos in this Kindle book make it at times a real head scratcher.  Here are some of the funnier ones:* Through the weakening of the causes of bondage, and by learning the method of sassing, the consciousness is transferred to the other body.* Vestures of consciousness are built up in conformity with the Boston of the feeling of selfhood.* In the internals of the batik, other thoughts will arise, through the impressions of the dynamic mind-images.I'm glad I had the Hartranft version to be able to figure out what was being said.Unlike Hartranft and most modern translators, Johnston takes exception with calling the sutras ""aphorisms"", pointing out that aphorisms are really standalone gems of wisdom, while sutras are interdependent. I kind of agree with that.  But, being an older translation, the word use is a bit quaint.  For example, Johnson likes the word ""psychic"", but more in the sense of psychological, not extrasensory perception.  He uses the phrase ""judicial action"" to connote ""reflection-free"".  He's fond of the word ""unwisdom"", which Hartranft translates as ""not seeing things as they are"".  And he does over-explain sutras that don't need that much explanation to comprehend.  But then, Hartranft goes into great detail also.The lesson to be learned is that, if you're interested in the original philosophy of Yoga and not just the postures, you should read more than one version of this seminal and relatively short book.  Translations are always tricky, so if you compare and contrast different versions from various time periods and interpreters, you'll achieve a better understanding of the original work.","06 21, 2014",A6J7GN6ZOR085,lonebeaut,Compare and contrast for a better understanding,1403308800

L'Amour was a staple when I was growing up, and I still return to him again and again as I go along.  Fair Blows the Wind remains my favorite novel by the author because it's such a combination of Old World swordplay, coming of age, and early Americana.  But that's beside the point.In James Brionne, L'Amour creates one of his best fighting men, a man who'd served in the Union Army during the Civil War, a man who had the ear of President Grant - and a man who had lost his wife to tragic circumstances.  The first few pages of the book draw the reader in and sets him on a journey to see good triumph over evil.The book is much as I remember it, written with a lot of introspection and bouncing around from character to character, with less action and tension than I would have liked.  L'Amour also instills a romantic lyricism in his word choice, though.  James Brionne is an educated man, a thinker, and that shows on the pages.There's no real tension about where the reader is going to get during the read because the endgame is almost transparent.  Still, L'Amour manages to throw a couple curves in there that will leave you unsettled about a few things as you turn the pages.I wish there had been a little more to the story, and even the ending just seems to coast to a halt rather than escalating.  The pieces just fall together without any real stress or narrative tension.The plot is pretty thin even for a L'Amour novel, but the tale pulled me through again, and even though I knew how the book ended, and would have known anyway because it's so clear, I enjoyed roving through the Old West and stepping through my own past.","06 11, 2013",A1U360OMVQRPUB,Mel Odom,Brionne,1370908800

For the most part I've been happy to get my news for free online from a variety of sources, but of late I've been craving a more consistent access to the kind of high quality news stories that WSJ is known for. I decided to check out several subscription options, and compare them to each other. The Kindle version, even though it is very limited in many respects, turns out to be pretty good and in line with my expectations for what I wanted to get out of reading WSJ.Once you subscribe to WSJ, you can setup the delivery to any one of your Kindle devices or enabled Kindle readers. You can also manually download the current issue of WSJ to another device, but the automatic downloads are enabled for only one device at the time (you can change which one in the online Kindle setting at any time). Kindle formatting of WSJ leaves a lot to be desired. As you may imagine, the reading experience will be much closer to reading a book than a newspaper. I don't mind this all that much, as WSJ has always been a pretty text-heavy newspaper. The exceptions are the graphs and charts, which can be almost illegible when presented on Kindle. The sections and articles are well organized and easily accessible through the menu, and I am overall pleased with the navigation options. In terms of formatting, I still prefer the dedicated WSJ iPad version, but the Kindle version gets the job done.One big difference between the Kindle version and those for various tablets is that you won't be able to access various embedded videos on Kindle (not even in the tablet version of Kindle software). Those small video clips are indeed a lot of fun, and definitely add to the overall ""reading"" experience. However, they also add to the size of the download, and unless you have a really fast wireless connection and the latest version of the tablet, the download can be choppy. For me these videos are a nice addition, but they are not crucial.As far as the price goes, yes, Wall Street Journal on Kindle is kind of expensive. However, keep in mind that you can in principle cancel your subscription without much trouble after any number of months has passed, something that in my experience is not that easy to pull off with a print subscription of any newspaper. I do consider WSJ to be a very high quality publication, and in my opinion the price is reasonable for the kind of content and convenience that you get. We've all been spoiled by the years of de-facto free online access to various newspapers and magazines, but unfortunately this free-for-all state of affairs has lead many fine journals and newspapers to shut down.If you are seeking the convenience and the ease of use that the Kindle version of WSJ provides, and are not too concerned with the formatting and various bells and whistles, then I'd definitely recommend that you check it out. So far I've been more satisfied than I had expected based on all the negative reviews that I have read.","03 3, 2012",A36K2N527TXXJN,Dr. Bojan Tunguz,"Convenient, Simply-formatted, Pricey",1330732800

First of all, I had one hell of a time getting it to open on the Kindle Fire.  After much fumbling, I managed.  There are some serious problems with the app: the type face sizes are too small (hardly larger than the print version) and now I can't get it to open on the iPad.  I could have continued with the online version on the iPad and Kindle (I'm going to start receiving the print version soon, I hope) cheaper - but opted for the Amazon version thinking mistakenly that I would be able to read it on the ipad with the larger screen.

After a cordial conversation with Amazon, I cancelled the order - the Amazon print version is nearly 50% more than the same offer from the WSJ.  I then bought the WSJ on line, logged in on my Kindle and presto - a decent readable product (type size is still too small) on line.

No, special white paint from government labs! It turns out any old white paint will do, that a government program is not necesaary, but the NYT did not say so. Irresponsible. In the area of health reporting, Pope wrote a silly article about a Dr. Kesler's book about food. She did not mention that, as head of the FDA, he was engaged in running battles with vitamin and food manufacturers for years. Many of these battles he lost in the courts, which is now why we can use aspirin for heart treatment, which is just as good as the expensive biotech drugs the FDA was touting. Uncritical and irresponsible reporting. A dereliction of the journalist's duty.And what about the economists like Krugman who don't have a clue about how to save the nation's economy. Yet they pontificate in those pages.If you are a times reader, i encourage you to find better sources.Later...To continue this rant, I posted a comment on the NYT website in response to an article.

93,B000GFK7L6,"[7, 8]",3,"When I first got my Kindle, one of the first things I did was take advantage of the 30 trial and subscribe to the NYT. At that time I think the monthly rate was either 11 something or 13 something. The novelty of it was great at first. Seriously, the only thing that makes a person feel spoiled about waking is a newspaper delivered right to your bedside is a butler and breakfast in bed, or so I imagine. It didn't particularly bother me about the features missing because the price was good and the convenience was amazing. In the middle of nowhere, it was feasible to get most, if not all, of the news that's fit to print. Good deal.The paper is usually a delight, but here's where the practical came in. I ended up falling into a pattern of not reading it every day, and what was initially perfectly fine. The subscription was a bargain. The paper was there on the days I wanted it. When they announced the subscription hike, I knew it wasn't for me, because it made it feel wasteful, it made me feel guilty to think of not reading it daily. Once something I read in my leisure time feels like an obligation... In my case, and your needs might be quite different, the folks at the paper priced it right off my Kindle -- except by invitation.There are still periodicals I do subscribe to, like Time and Newsweek, blogs like Slate, and  a few others where the prices are in a range that I don't feel horrible if I skip an issue. With newspapers, however, I prefer to buy a single issue when I feel like it or if there's an event I see as historical. Sunday usually has me buying 3-4 papers to read over breakfast and throughout the day. (NYT, of course,  The Sunday NYT is heaven; my hometown paper, The Detroit Free Press; The San Francisco Chronicle; and often the Boston Globe. I feel more spoiled than ever now, because I'm taking advantage of having the papers *I* want, when I want them, without getting the editions I don't want, and it takes 2 minutes to select and receive them. When I hear of a good article on a day when I haven't purchased, it's usually found online.My recommendation is to get the trial and see what you think. See if you read it daily. See if it feels like a bargain. The beauty of the Kindle format is the convenience and so it only matters what method works for you -- subscription or my method of buying as needed.The NYT is 4 or 5 stars on the days I read it, but too expensive for me to maintain a subscription and allow issues to remain unread, so I'm giving it 3 stars overall since most people are probably reading this with subscribing in mind and strongly suggesting potential subscribers take advantage of the trial period.","12 8, 2010",A30YCQ4MOZAI6Y,Michelle R,I love the NYT -- sometimes.

However, it is an extremely abridged version of the paper.  So if you need some information like theater schedules, you need to use the online version.  The Kindle version is particularly bad since it has very little of the actual paper information.  It also is far inferior to the online version.

I suggest getting the free BBC app and USA today free version (not that I particularly like USA today).  But the combination of these two free services is far superior to the NYT Kindle version.

I am not a big print newspaper fan, I find them environmentally unfriendly, dirty (think blank ink on hand), and they contain a lot of information I usually have no interest in (ads, sports, stock lists, etc.) so they are thicker than I need them to be and messy. I won't even take the two free papers offered at the subway on most days (the excellent Metro and the whiny bloggy Boston Now). On the other hand I find the web version of newspapers hard to drill down to find the articles that apply only to today - if you know the topic you can do a search but there's really no way to tell if I at least skimmed all the articles for the day.Enter the Kindle edition which solves most of my complaints about the print and web edition of the Boston Globe, while all the material I am not interested in is still there it is easy to bypass and doesn't really cause any clutter or eat up resources (a few kb of disc space I guess).

If you want more detail you can select the headline link. You can then once finished reading the article (or deciding only to read some of it or none of it) easily hit the back button to return to the list, or if you've finished the article you can go forward directly to the next story (comes in handy in your favorite section if you know you want to read most articles there).

114,B000JMKNQ0,"[4, 4]",4,"Karen Traviss was noted during her time as a Star Wars author for her fascination with the Mandalorian culture along with her disdain for the Jedi. These traits fueled several exceptional stories in the Republic Commando novels but also started to become a bit of a distraction over time, especially as her stories became increasingly drenched in Mandalorian worship. It's an interesting choice to have her author a short story (originally an e-book) for the New Jedi Order, as beyond a nod in the final volume, Mandalorians are conspicuously absent. This story is very much like her full length Star Wars novels: Mandalorian focused, chapters starting with intriguing italicized quotes from various in-universe sources, and a very cinematic way of staging scenes and cutting between them.So it turns out the choice was a good one: having Ms. Traviss bring her sensibilities to the New Jedi Order provides a sorely-needed shift from the overall tone of the nineteen novels. It's fascinating how she juxtaposes Boba Fett and his allies against the Yuuzhan Vong, two cultures both comfortable with violence as a means to an end but diametrically opposed as to the means. This story is set chronologically before Vector Prime, meaning it could be a reader's first introduction to the Yuuzhan Vong culture, and overall I would say that's neither worse nor better than first encountering them via Vector Prime. It's just different, as Vector Prime shows the Vong through the lens of the Jedi and here we meet them through the alternate viewpoint of Mandalorian mercenaries.This story brings us up-to-date on an older Boba Fett, one still living the mercenary life while also having responsibilities as the Mandalore, the leader of his people. It's an interesting dynamic how Fett feels a sense of duty to this role while simultaneously keeping it at arm's length. The sequences where Fett and a companion walk through a Vong vessel and encounter the extra-galactic invaders for the first time is superb, as we see their disgusted reactions to the bloody Vong culture firsthand. The ending of the story leaves the Mandalorians as true anti-heroes, secretly doing the right thing while being openly despised for their seemingly traitorous actions. I would have liked to see this thread interwoven throughout the New Jedi Order, but alas, A Practical Man was penned late in the game.Despite any misgivings I developed over time with Ms. Traviss' tendency to elevate the Mandalorians and demonize the Jedi in her writing, there is no denying that she was an exceptional Star Wars author. Her stories are distinct, hard-edged, and propel along much like the films themselves, even when they get heavy on dialogue vs. action. Boba Fett: A Practical Man is a distinct entity in the New Jedi Order and well worth a read: even better, it could be read by someone interested in Fett and his people without having to go further in the nineteen books that follow.","03 15, 2012",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",Worthwhile addition to the New Jedi Order,1331769600

This time, Karen Traviss combines fan favorite Boba Fett and NJO favorite Nom Anor to show the Mandalorians' role in the Yuuzhan Vong war. Traviss does a pretty good job fitting both into their characters. Boba Fett is appropriately cynical, but at the same time also concerned about the Mandalorians. Traviss doesn't yet go so far as to make Boba Fett one of the good guys. It's an interesting character transformation. We also get to see Nom Anor's private thoughts and a bit more insight into his time as infiltrator.Even for a short story, it seemed a bit too short and ends rather abruptly. I would have liked to have seen  bit more, or at least learn what the Mandalorians did after the first few weeks of the invasion.

This is more of Karen Traviss' mary-sue adventures of Boba Fett and the almighty, infallible, infinitely over-detailed and completely boring Mandalorians, who bear a strong resemblance to Scottish Highlanders in an average B-grade romance novel.It's stuff like this that makes me glad she has decided to stop writing Star Wars.As usual, Traviss throws out established canon to match her ideas and fit her story. This book is pointless, as the whole premise is flawed, based on a non-canon idea, and will be zapped out of existence once the T-Canon episodes of Clone Wars (which trump the C-Canon (soon to be S-Canon or N-Canon) ideas in Traviss' books.)Traviss has managed to take one of the coolest characters in the Star Wars universe and turn him into one of the most annoying, uninteresting, boring, obnoxious, mary-sue characters ever written. She took the quiet cool of Boba Fett, and turned him into a character who just Wouldn't Shut Up. She took Mandalorians and turned them from an elusive, lost, dying race of people who were cooler for having been scattered across the galaxy, into a clan of dancing, singing, Mando'a speaking, boastful morons whose place in canon is now a convoluted mess.And don't get me started on how plodding and over-detailed her writing is. If you want to know every tiny, minuscule, stupid thing about a character, just turn to Traviss' books. You're lucky if she doesn't tell you how, when, and where Boba acquired his underwear, and what they're made of.Suffice it to say, I'm not a fan of Traviss' work. I consider her Star Wars books to be a notch below Barbara Hambly's disastrous efforts. Read this only if you're a huge fan of Traviss, or a huge fan of Non-Canon Star Wars books... Because this one can't stand up to scrutiny.","08 13, 2009",A1J75JJ0Q2OEJN,Raven A. Wind,A Good Reason Not to Miss Traviss' Star Wars Books,1250121600

When I saw this book on Amazon I was delighted and I was even more excited when I found out that she wrote it!***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***I knew from the Star Wars comics that the Mandalorians were involved in the Vong War during their invasion and that they fought alongside them against the New Republic.  But this e-book really helped fill in the gaps that the comics and the novels left.  I knew they weren't just in it for the credits!The visuals that Karen Travis paints with her story were just amazing!  Having Boba Fett walking through the depths of one of the Vong's ships was great!  I could almost smell the slime oozing from the walls and hear the squishing of his boots as he walked across the pulsing floor.  Also, having him compare being in the ship to being back inside the Sarlaac pit was very cool as well.During the book, the Mandalorians are faced with a moral dilemma.  They have signed up with the Vong, thinking they are just an army that wants to wreck a few worlds and they'll get some quick cash off of it.  But it turns out it's an entire invasion armada and they want to destroy the entire galaxy!  Boba Fett and the Mandalorians have already taken the job so they are honor bound to stand by their word and fight alongside the Vong against the New Republic.  However in doing so, Fett adds on that the Vong have to leave his home planet of Mandalore alone.  They agree and of course they are lying to him.  But this gives Boba Fett the time he needs to mobilize his people for war.  And when you have the entire population of the Mandalorian home world gunning for you, you might just want to reconsider your course of action!While fighting alongside the Vong, Boba Fett manages to sneak information to the New Republic about the Vong, their plans, their technology and their biology.  Eventually the New Republic wises up and realizes that the Mandos are double agents and they send a Jedi Master to parley with Boba Fett.  He tells the Jedi to keep this under wraps and to keep fighting against the Mandalorians as if they are the true enemy in order to keep up the ruse so they can continue to slip the New Republic information about the invaders.  The Jedi Master asks what Fett wants in return.  He only asks for one thing, that the Republic knows that a Mandalorian warrior died to save a Jedi Master.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***This book was awesome!  Karen Traviss continued to do what she did best in the Star Wars universe, writing for Boba Fett and the Mandalorians.  It really is too bad that she and the rest of the Star Wars writers had a falling out due to creative differences and that she is no longer writing for Star Wars.  I would have loved to read more of her work in a Star Wars setting.","05 18, 2013",A12LKEM543ILBK,zombie phreak,Terrific!!!,1368835200

I kept wanting to say, ""Whoa, slow down.  Let's learn about the characters before they go running off to be super heroes.""The Devlin Group is a group who stops Big Bad things from happening - like spreading poison all over Gitmo.Alex Rossi is the Super Hero leader who, at one time, worked with Grace, the Super Heroine. They were a great team with both of them equally able to get to the bad guys.  Alex also doubles as Sean Devlin, the founder of the Group.  He named the group Devlin to flush out the man who killed his Mother 11 years ago.  Grace was not aware of this story.  Alex and Grace had a baby but Alex was never told about him because Grace wanted to keep the baby, Danny, safe from the Super Hero's enemies.  All of this is for naught as Danny is kidnapped.  While this sounds somewhat complicated, Stacey does a good job of keeping things clear and the reader is never confused as to the story line.There are two other major characters, Carmen and Gallagher, who also help with the Devlin Group.The downside is that this adventure/romance is told so fast that there is little character development.  I know about as much about Carmen and Gallagher as you do right now. There was a whole story there left on the cutting room floor, so to speak, and the book would have been much better if Stacey had taken the time to allow the reader an insight into these two characters.Alex and Grace are somewhat better developed but still leave a bit to be desired.  Grace comes off somewhat naive in the ways of motherhood, to put it nicely.  For some reason we never know, she thinks being able to make cookies is more important in the raising of a child than allowing said child to get to know his father.  Go figure.  I still want to know what makes Grace tick.Stacey has talent but needs to learn a little about character development.  If the reader knows the characters, they care what happens to them.  While this is an exciting story, I never really cared if the characters lived or died except for what would happen to the child.","10 17, 2009",A109E01LB4H38F,"Carol Donaho ""Carol Donaho""",Way too fast!,1255737600

Pooter, a senior bank clerk in the City renting a home in a London suburb of Holloway, encapsulates Victorian respectability, snobbery, and pretensions. Pooter nearly invariably gets the short end of the stick in his interactions with his two neighbors, Cummings and Gowings; his spendthrift, reckless son Lupin; and the various tradesmen and servants he attempts to bully. Slavishly devoted to his employer, Mr. Perkupp, Pooter tries without much luck to cut his son into the same mold. Instead, Lupin slacks at work and spends his nights engaged in amateur theatrics or carousing with his chums till all hours. What's a father to do?First serialized in Punch in 1888 and 1889, The Diary of a Nobody was published in book form in 1892 and hasn't been out of print since.

It is huge, containing souls from multiple worlds, creatures only imagined by later SciFy authors. Multiple gates, minimal entry conditions. There is a caste system, and receptions for those who never received reward during life.I wish that wings were more than decoration, but according to Sandy, an elderly resident, you travel by WISHING yourself around to greet new arrivals, or return to earth with divine messages. Most inhabitants only dress up for formal occasions- halo, harp and wings being a sort of uniform.Sandy tells Stormfield: Heaven is a libertarian place- plenty of room, do as you please, appear any age- but it is not paradise as imagined on earth. Idleness does get old, and please do not irritate the patriarchs. Sandy is a keen observer of people in Heaven.The rest of the tale is similarly imaginative. Twain enlivens things by speaking in the argot of a 19th century sailing master, sprinkling dialogue with phrases like:' An ordinary comet don't make more than about 200,000 miles a minute.  Of course when I came across one of that sort--like Encke's and Halley's comets, for instance--it warn't anything but just a flash and a vanish, you see.  You couldn't rightly call it a race.  It was as if the comet was a gravel-train and I was a telegraph despatch.  But after I got outside of our astronomical system, I used to flush a comet occasionally that was something like.  We haven't got any such comets--ours don't begin.  One night I was swinging along at a good round gait, everything taut and trim, and the wind in my favor--I judged I was going about a million miles a minute--it might have been more, it couldn't have been less--when I flushed a most uncommonly big one about three points off my starboard bow.

This book was written during World War 1. The Western Front in the subtitle is the line where the westward-moving German army was being met by the armies of the countries they were invading. Arnold Bennett was a novelist who was Director of Propaganda for France at the Ministry of Information during the war. That's the background, on to the book...Bennett tells of the time he spent moving from town to town in France and Belgium along the Front. He is always escorted by a military officer, and they often walk through trenches and have to take cover if an artillery shell explodes nearby. He frequently goes into detail about towns and buildings that have been damaged or destroyed by the Germans. It's not a very personal book- he seldom writes about people he meets or relates conversations. Occasionally he muses on the absurdity of what the Germans are doing, and what it is costing in terms of people's lives and livelihoods. His cynicism shines through at those moments. The book will be best enjoyed by war buffs, but it's short, and an excellent description of a war zone, so I recommend it to people who don't normally read war books as well.","04 5, 2010",A39A6B9YR9R0L6,Phil,Life on the Western Front during World War 1,1270425600

To call them brutes or barbarians and murderers is not enough.  What they perpetrated on Europe in two world wars is beyond comprehension.  After viewing the wanton, unnecessary, almost childish destruction caused by the retreating Germans, the author actually hopes that one German city will be levelled entirely, as punishment, retribution, and as a lesson to future Germans that wars of expansion in Europe are unwanted and will be avenged.  This did not happen.Author tours the French and British trenches and rear areas, giving amazing insight into the French military psyche at the time.  That part, I enjoyed the most.

Then the plot weakens....One of the book's biggest mysteries must be that, whilst huge numbers of indiginent Pacific islanders evolve by scratching out a living fishing off a sand-bar of an island, this extemely large, visible (it has a huge mountain in the middle) island, remains undiscovered. A pity because this surely must be one of the most verdant, farming-friendly, mineral wealthy islands on Earth. It is also extremely well-stocked with all manner of useful, & tasty beasts. Our heroes, in a few short years, manage to become completely self-sufficient & are soon spoilt for choice as to where to abide & what to have for supper.I would estimate that a full eighty percent of the plot is dedicated to the ingenious, almost miraculous, development of the island's bounty. Our five heroes are the most innovative of castaways; nothing is beyond them. During their time on the island they have the know-how & resources to produce bricks, pottery, ironware, gunpowder, nitro-glycerene, etc. etc., even introducing a telegraph system & no detail is spared in the descriptions of each operation. As a consequence the book reads like a cross between Handyman's Journal, Construction Weekly & Farming Monthly.The castaways are a deadly boring bunch. They quickly become firm friends; respectful, tolerant & pass their time in mutual hero-worship & devotion. They are such a 'hail-fellow & well met' group that there is a complete absence of any sort of jealousy, resentment, discontent or moaning; indeed a complete absence of any emotional excitement.There is a mystery involved but I didn't feel it worth the effort of wading through the massive amount of technical details to find out the end result.Look here for blandness & do-it-yourself tips; look elsewhere for adventure.","07 30, 2011",A5CA9579GD7HJ,Bob Jarvis,Handyman's Journal,1311984000

""For heavens sake heave out the ballast!"" ""There! The last sack is empty!"" ""Does the balloon rise?"" ""No!"" ""I hear a noise like the dashing of waves! The sea is below the car. It cannot be more than 500 feet from us!"" ""Overboard with every weight!...everything!""I must say, that listening to this (via the Kindle's speech feature while I was driving) was better than having to read all those exclamation points, but I was hooked and enjoyed the vicarious adventure.Jules Verne's MYSTERIOUS ISLAND embraces the ever-popular story line of men surviving--even thriving--on a deserted island, but instead of getting there by shipwreck, these men have escaped from a Civil War Richmond under siege in a hot air balloon and are blown thousands of miles off course in the grip of a raging storm. Eventually, their balloon loses air and they fall into the sea and are washed up on an island. There they establish a settlement, and with remarkable know-how, tenacity, and courage, they make quite a nice life for themselves that lasts about four years, despite the challenges of tempest, wild animals, injuries, pirates, and, most intriguingly, a mysteriously benevolent but invisible presence that seems to defy the castaways' belief that they are alone on the island.This book was written in 1874, and must surely have been influenced by SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON which was written in 1812. The similarities are striking in the remarkably clever things the castaways envisioned, built or fabricated to ensure their comfort and safety...everything from their lodging and outbuildings to a small sailing ship. Between them, they conveniently brought extensive knowledge of engineering, sailing, ship-building, astronomy, geography, botany, and chemistry.The book does bog down occasionally, and the 19th century language is somewhat stilted. Every conversation seemed to include a ""my boy"" or ""my man""  or ""my friend"" (e.g., ""'No doubt, my boy,' answered the engineer...""). The characters were ennobled by the author to be unrealistic paradigms of 19th century virtue: industrious, courageous, practical, and compassionate.But these are quibbles in the face of the pleasure given by such a good story, and the way Jules Verne tied this book in with the story from 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA was an interesting and unexpected twist. This book is a classic for a reason.","02 12, 2011",AFFGYGNO989PD,"Elizabeth H. Cottrell ""RiverwoodWriter""",Rollicking adventure,1297468800

It starts in 1865, March, Richmond, VA. The capital of the Confederacy is under siege by the Union Army under Lt. Gen. U. S. Grant.Five men, Cyrus, Pencroft, Herbert, Neb and Gideon, and a dog named Top are trapped in Richmond and wish to escape from the town. The weather is bad, but there is a balloon tethered in the middle of town, and the storm seems to provide some cover as the Confederates are less attentive with the storm. They get into the balloon with a dog and set off on an adventure. They are blown west by the storm, and end up over the ocean, with the balloon losing altitude, when they very fortunately to crash on a tropical island, which turns out to be volcanic and large enough to have a variety on the island.Interesting that Verne uses a balloon which is only coming into use, as the device to get his folks onto the deserted tropical island.The five men are a good collection of skills and personalities and work well together. Captain Cyrus is their knowledgeable and inspiring leader with an engineer's practical knowledge. Pencroft, is a practical and hardworking sailor. Gideon is kind of a ""everyman"" -- observant, strong and resourceful and loving. Herbert a young, man learning and becoming a naturalist. It is a well done book where the whole crew works hard to make a life for themselves on the island using what is available. They do an excellent job using what is at hand, and make chemicals including nitroglycerine, using what is on the island.A well done and interesting adventure tale.

The only complaint was that there was a lot of detail put into all the different mechanisms they had to make.

They are thrown onto an island that isn't listed on any maps and well out of the way for any ships in the Pacific to go by. They even go on a short trip to a close but un-useful island to help a castaway. For four long years these escapees have to start from nothing to make themselves a civilized dwelling. They create everything from a house in granite rock and a garden and an animal farm to any mechanism they might need to create something to survive with. They spend their days working and building and creating all the necessities as well as some wants. They build two ships and at the last second when they fear death, they are saved. There are references to 20,000 leagues under the seas and captain Nemo as well as historical things.The story is long but with all the details you learn not only to feel like you know the islanders but also enough to see their surroundings and feel their anxieties.

I read this story first over fifty years ago while it was being held between the hardback bindings of a library book in conjunction with Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and In Search of the Castaways.  After I discovered how exciting Jules Verne's writings truly were I started reading all of his books that I could find and I most certainty appreciated every one of them.  When I saw ""The Mysterious Island"" in eBook format on Amazon I simply had to have a copy.  It is now my desire to acquire all the books that I have read and the books I now have in my personal hard-copy library, in the eBook format.  Even though we have grown up reading hardback and paperback books, enjoying the smell of printer's ink and experiencing the feeling of a good binding and fine paper in our hands, we no longer are able to collect them in their original format due to lack of available shelf space.  I have discovered that being able to carry all of my books around in my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is not a bad way to go after all.  Hunting through book shelf after book shelf for a novel or digging through box after box of books which we had to place in storage because our books were completely taking over our home, looking for just the right book, has unfortunately become unrealistic.

292,B000JMLBHU,"[1, 1]",4,"This is Jules Verne's attempt at writing a Robinson Crusoe / Swiss Family Robinson castaway story, with the twist that the five castaways crash-land a balloon and thus come to the island with almost nothing -- unlike Crusoe or the Swiss Family, the castaways here don't have a boat-full of resources, tools, etc., to fall back on, and have to make *everything* themselves, from the ground up, armed only with their knowledge of science and engineering. Since it always seemed to me that Crusoe and the Swiss Family cheated a bit by bringing so many tools and so forth along with themselves, I really enjoyed the more scientific focus, and this has now replaced Swiss Family as my answer to the ""what one book would you want with you on a desert island?"" question.Parts of the novel drag a bit, but it's a Jules Verne novel so there's a good story here -- the Island has a mysterious unseen inhabitant, also, there are pirates, which is always awesome.The main flaw is that this is based on the 1875 Kingston translation, which makes a fair number of edits on Verne's original -- for example, it changes some of the protagonists's names and removes some of Captain Nemo's anti-imperialist, anti-british rhetoric. There's a more accurate translation available for free in the Kindle store, so I'd recommend grabbing the accurate version instead (look for the edition where the engineer is named Cyrus Smith, rather than Cyrus Harding;  Kingston reportedly felt ""Smith"" was a ""gypsy name"" and hence unsuitable for a heroic character. You can find that version in the kindle store here:The Mysterious Island)Oh, yeah, Captain Nemo. This book is in some ways a sequel to Verne's _Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas_, as well as to his _In Search of the Castaways_. The sequence isn't direct -- really more a case of cameo characters than a direct plot sequel to either book -- but you might want to read those two books first before picking this one up.","06 11, 2010",A1KPDKD7VYRE3B,T.
